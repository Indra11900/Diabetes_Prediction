# Diabetes_Prediction
Machine learning project for predicting diabetes using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects millions of people worldwide, and early prediction can be crucial for effective management and treatment.

# Overview
This GitHub repository hosts a machine learning project for predicting diabetes using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects millions of people worldwide, and early prediction can be crucial for effective management and treatment. This project aims to provide a reliable tool for predicting the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on relevant health data.

# Key Features
1. Utilizes the powerful Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for classification.
2. Preprocessing and feature engineering techniques to enhance model performance.
3. Evaluation metrics for assessing the model's accuracy and reliability.
4. User-friendly Jupyter Notebook for easy exploration and understanding of the project.
5. Sample dataset for testing and experimentation.
6. Well-documented code and detailed explanations.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various health-related features, including glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, and more. These attributes are used to train and test the SVM model for diabetes prediction.

# Usage
The Jupyter Notebook in this repository provides detailed instructions on how to use the SVM-based diabetes prediction model. Users can follow along, modify the code, and integrate it into their own projects.
